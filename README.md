## Command Line

The `nepcal` CLI was initially inspired from the `cal` command on Linux, but expanded to have much more functionality, namely:

- Show the current Nepali month's calendar (Similar to `cal`)
- Show today's Nepali date and day
- Convert A.D. (gregorian) dates to B.S. dates and vice-versa.

## Installation

There are several ways to install the CLI. Pick the one that best suits you from the options below. In any case, run `nepcal` on your terminal; if you see some formatted output then you are good to go.

### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built tarball executables/binaries are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/srishanbhattarai/nepcal/releases) page for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
Download and untar the binary for your platform, then move it into your executable path. e.g. `/usr/local/bin` on Mac or Linux.

You might need to give the script execution permissions. On Linux and MacOS this would mean using `chmod` as follows:

```sh
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nepcal
```

### Homebrew on Mac

Tap the repository first.

```sh
$ brew tap srishanbhattarai/nepcal https://github.com/srishanbhattarai/nepcal
```

Then, run:

```sh
$ brew install nepcal
```

### Using `go get`

You can also install `nepcal` manually if you have the Go toolchain installed.

```sh
$ go get -v github.com/srishanbhattarai/nepcal/cmd/nepcal
```

Complete details can be found by running `nepcal help`.

## Library

If you would like to use `nepcal` as a Go library, the best reference is the [Godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/srishanbhattarai/nepcal/nepcal) documentation for this package which should be fairly easy to navigate. The CLI tool is also built on this library. However, there are additional functionalities provided in the library that are not relevant in the CLI, for example the [`NumDaysSpanned()`](https://godoc.org/github.com/srishanbhattarai/nepcal/nepcal#Time.NumDaysSpanned) method.

## Acknowledgements

`nepcal` uses [`nepcal.com`](http://nepcal.com/) as the source of information used to create this tool. Among several sources, they were deemed most reliable.

The name `nepcal` was independently chosen for this project which happened to coincide with the website.
